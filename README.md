# Description

This is a javascript implementation of a basic Fizzbuzz algorithm. It returns
fizz for numbers divisible by 3, buzz for those divisible by 5, fizzbuzz for
those divisible by both, and the input for those divisible by neither.
Additionally, a loop method gives the fizzbuzz values for a range of numbers.

# Testing

Testing is fully implemented from scratch using a custom reporter and a
colors module for more user-friendly feedback. Both these tests and the
expected outcome of the challenge can be obtained by running

```nodejs fizzbuzz_test.js```
